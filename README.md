## Supported platforms

Currently, we officially support Linux and MacOS. However, Windows and FreeBSD support are planned.

ARM and x86 architectures are also officially supported.

## Features

- Minimal, statically linked binary of ~2MB on Linux
- Listing attached disks, and telling you their size and hardware model information
- Confirmation dialogs so you don't `dd` your filesystem
- Automatically decompressing your input file
- Verifying your disk to make sure it was written correctly
- Running sudo for you if you don't have permissions on a disk
- Cool graphs

## Planned features

- Support for more platforms
- Post-burn patching (i.e. adding `ssh` and `wpa_supplicant.conf` files to Raspberry Pi disks)
- Lightweight GUI

## FAQ

### Why did you make this?

Because I wanted a nice, user-friendly wrapper around `dd` that wasn't like, a 90 MB executable that packages Chromium and eats hundreds of MB of RAM like certain other disk burning softwares do.

### Why is it called "Caligula"?

Because there used to be a tool called Nero Burning ROM, so I chose another crazy Roman emperor to name this software after. It's a very uncreative name and I might rename it later.

### Why Rust?

Because it's ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ BLAZING FAST ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ and ðŸ’¾ðŸ’¾ðŸ’¾ MEMORY SAFE ðŸ’¾ðŸ’¾ðŸ’¾
